# SOC176 - RDP Brute Force Detected

In this project, I investigated a simulated security incident on the LetsDefend platform, where a Windows machine was targeted by a brute-force attack on the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The attacker attempted multiple login attempts using various usernames, eventually gaining unauthorized access to the system.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- **Identified** a brute-force attack targeting RDP on a Windows machine.
- **Analyzed** Windows Security Event Logs to trace failed and successful login attempts.
- **Detected** post-compromise activities indicating potential privilege escalation.
- **Mapped** the attack techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
- **Recommended** mitigation strategies to prevent similar future incidents.
